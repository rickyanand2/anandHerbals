The Model is the part of the application that handles the logic for the application data.
Often model objects retrieve data (and store data) from a database.

The View is the parts of the application that handles the display of the data.
Most often the views are created from the model data.

The Controller is the part of the application that handles user interaction.
Typically controllers read data from a view, control user input, and send input data to the model.
