A few hints:
– Using addslashes() for escaping is bad practice
– Storing passwords unencrypted is bad practice
– session_register() is deprecated
– A valid location headers require a full URL
– lock.php makes no sense. The existence of a username and / or user ID in the session is sufficient, 
if the authentication was done properly. (Unless you want to check for every single request 
if a user account has been disabled or deleted.)

/*  
The Model is the part of the application that handles the logic for the application data.
Often model objects retrieve data (and store data) from a database.

The View is the parts of the application that handles the display of the data.
Most often the views are created from the model data.

The Controller is the part of the application that handles user interaction.
Typically controllers read data from a view, control user input, and send input data to the model.
